# QuizApp
A QuizApp made using Kotlin with an aim to make learning fun for children in pre-school. It consists of general knowledge questions of various domians like science,history,etc  to attempt.
At the end of the quiz marks are also given and app users are informed about their right or wrong choice while attempting the quiz itself, so that they can improve upon. We try to make boring subject of general knowledge as precieved by most pre-schoolers interesting, by making it a game and prompting them to get themselves up to date with their environment.
